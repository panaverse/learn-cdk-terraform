# Learn Multicloud Serverless API Development using CDK Terraform

In this learning repository we will learn to develop serverless REST and GraphQL APIs with CDK for Terraform using TypeScript. For databases we will learn to use serverless Relational, Graph, and NoSQL databases. These serverless APIs will help move the world towards the API economy.

Cloud Computing has revolutionized the world of information and technology. From the way we deploy and maintain applications to the development practices, everything has been highly impacted by Cloud Computing. All new applications are developed to be cloud-native and compatible with cloud services.

Cloud Computing helps us develop highly available, scalable, and efficient architectures, which makes cloud services more and more in demand. With this boom in cloud computing comes a need to maintain infrastructure as a code. Maintaining cloud resources manually via console can be a complex task that can be very difficult to track.

Infrastructure as a code, aka IaC, solves this problem. By using IaC, we can define our resources as code and use this code to provision cloud services. Using infrastructure as a code allows multiple developers to collaborate on infrastructure and keep track of the changes made by developers.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a core pillar of a healthy cloud computing. Currently enterprises are evolving towards multicloud strategy, all-in-one multi-cloud tools and solutions are required. 

Terraform is your all-in-one multi-cloud solution! Terraform allows you to dynamically provision infrastructure across multiple cloud providers, so your workflows and processes can remain the same even as the world around you changes. You can not only use Terraform with AWS but also with other cloud providers like Azure or GCP. Terraform is a great tool to create multi-cloud deployments and have any number of cloud providers for your application.

Provisioning infrastructure across multiple clouds increases fault tolerance, allowing for more graceful recovery from cloud provider outages. However, multi-cloud deployments add complexity because each provider has its own interfaces, tools, and workflows. Terraform lets you use the same workflow to manage multiple providers and handle cross-cloud dependencies. This simplifies management and orchestration for large-scale, multi-cloud infrastructures.

As simple as Terraform is, it is a new language, and you will need to train your developers in a whole new language that is not similar to the other programming languages in use. More importantly, data manipulation in Terraform is not as simple as in other programming languages.

CDK for Terraform takes multicloud development to next level, you can write Terraform configurations in your choice of TypeScript, C#, Python, Java or Go, and still benefit from the full ecosystem of Terraform providers and modules. This makes life very easy for developers and allowing them develop multicloud applications without learning any additional language.

Serverless computing has emerged as a new compelling paradigm for the deployment of applications and services. It represents an evolution of cloud programming models, abstractions, and platforms, and is a testament to the maturity and wide adoption of cloud technologies. Serverless computing is created to solve the problem of allocating cloud compute resources. Serverless was built to tackle this problem by adding automation that eliminates the need for users to predetermine the amount of compute resources necessary for their workload. Serverless is the future.

The world is moving towards the API economy. It refers to the controlled exchange of digital data and services through APIs. The API economy is the combined value exchange between providers of APIs and consumers of them â€” both of which exist within a company and beyond. Using APIs to expose core business capabilities externally sets the business itself up as a platform, ripe for third party innovation upon.

The API economy is not a technical concept, nor is it a financial model. Instead, it reflects an ecosystem of mutually beneficial exchange of data and digital services.

Although an organization can be entirely API-driven internally, the primary focus of the API economy is B2C and B2B. A classic example is the cloud itself, which giants like Amazon revolutionized. The AWS cloud is nothing but a massive collection of APIs that offers access to the Amazon infrastructure and application resources. Other well-documented examples include Twilio, Google Maps, and Stripe.
